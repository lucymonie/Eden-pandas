      <h1>Giant Pandas</h1>
        <h2>Giant pandas live in China</h2>
          <p>They mostly live in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu, which are in central China.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
          <p>Giant pandas live in the mountains because people kept on cutting down the trees in the places where
            they live and now they have to live in the mountains.</p>
          <p>The people who cut down the places wanted to grow wood and rice for their families.</p>

        <h2>Population</h2>
          <p>There are only one thousand and six hundred giant pandas left in the wild and in zoos there are three hundred more.</p>
          <p>Giant pandas eat bamboo. Pandas are actually omnivores but their very favourite food is bamboo.</p>

        <h2>Dangers</h2>
          <p>Giant pandas are endangered because snow leopards eat them, and because farmers take the place that they used to live.</p>
          <p>Giant pandas are being protected from people by making sure that the pandas have somewhere to live and people have
            places to grow their rice.</p>
